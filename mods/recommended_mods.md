# List of *recommended* mods


## What does *recommended* mean?

Recommended is a special category that doesn't have anything to do with leserver in particular, and more with the Minecraft experience in general. Here you can find some mods that I recommend for a better Minecraft experience.

## The list

| Mod | Note |
| :---: | :--- |
| [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api/versions) | Required for mods mods |
| [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium/versions) | For better video performance |
| [Sodium Extra](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium-extra/versions) | More options for Sodium |
| [Reese's Sodium Options](https://modrinth.com/mod/reeses-sodium-options/versions) | Better Video Settings menu for ***Sodium Extra*** |
| [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium/versions) | For better Sodium compatibility with *some* mods (if you run into graphical glitches, you may want to try using this) |
| [Ok Zoomer](https://modrinth.com/mod/ok-zoomer/versions) | For smooth zooming (the default keybind is `C`, like with OptiFine) |
| [Iris](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris/versions) | For shaders. To be used with Sodium. I recommend [Complementary Shaders](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/complementary-shaders/files/all)*
| [FerriteCore](https://modrinth.com/mod/ferrite-core/versions) | Reduces the memory (RAM) usage |
| [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) | For better lighting performance

Note: You need to find the versions for 1.18.2 for the above mods (Under `Supports` it should say `1.19.2`)

\*Find a version for 1.19.2 (Under `Game Version` it should say `1.19.2`; also, if there is a +1/+2/+3/etc. next to the version under `Game Version`, hover over the +1/+2/+3/etc. to see all the versions the pack supports)
