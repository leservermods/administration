# List of *required* mods leserver has installed

## What does *required* mean?

Required means that you *must* install these mods to join the server. If you don't install these mods, you *might* still be able to join, but you won't get the full experience and your client will crash when it encounters modded items/blocks.

## The list

Mod | Version | Requires
:---: | :---: | :---:
[Consistency+](https://modrinth.com/mod/consistencyplus) | [v0.5.0-RC2+1.18.2](https://modrinth.com/mod/consistencyplus/version/0.5.0-RC2+Fabric-1.18.2) | [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api/versions)* <br> [Architectury API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/architectury-fabric/files/all)**

\*Find a version for 1.18.2 (Under `Supports` it should say `1.18.2`) <br>
\*\*Find a version for 1.18.2 (Under `Game Version` it should say `1.18.2`; also, if there is a +1/+2/+3/etc. next to the thing under `Game Version`, hover over the +1/+2/+3/etc. to see all the versions the mod supports)

## Notes

If you have already installed ***any*** of the mods here for `1.18.2` *and* they are the correct versions (only applies if a specific version is provided here) *and* they are working, then there's no need to reinstall anything.
