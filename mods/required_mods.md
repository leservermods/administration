# List of *required* mods leserver has installed

## Warning
***Some explanations on this page might be outdated!***

## What does *required* mean?

Required means that you *must* install these mods to join the server. If you don't install these mods, you *might* still be able to join, but you won't get the full experience and your client may crash when it encounters modded items/blocks.

\* Find a version for 1.19.2 (Under `Supports` it should say `1.19.2`) <br>
\*\* Find a version for 1.19.2 (Under `Game Version` it should say `1.19.2`; also, if there is a +1/+2/+3/etc. next to the thing under `Game Version`, hover over the +1/+2/+3/etc. to see all the versions the mod supports) <br>
~~\*\*\* This version of Consistency+ is mislabeled. While the modrinth page references version `0.5.1`, the file you download will have `0.5.0` in its name, but it is actually version `0.5.1`.~~ <br>
\*\*\*\* `QFAPI` - Quilted Fabric API; `QSL` - Quilt Standard Libraries; both come in the same mod <br>

## Notes

If you have already installed ***any*** of the mods here for `1.19.2` *and* they are the correct versions (only applies if a specific version is provided here) *and* they are working, then there's no need to reinstall anything.
