# List of *required* mods leserver has installed

## What does *required* mean?

Required means that you *must* install these mods to join the server. If you don't install these mods, you *might* still be able to join, but you won't get the full experience and your client will crash when it encounters modded items/blocks.

## The list

Mod | Version | Requires
:---: | :---: | :---:
[Consistency+](https://modrinth.com/mod/consistencyplus) | [v0.5.1+1.18.2](https://modrinth.com/mod/consistencyplus/version/0.5.1%2BFabric-1.18.2)\*\*\* | [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api/versions)* <br> [Architectury API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/architectury-fabric/files/all)**
[Universal Ores](https://modrinth.com/mod/universal_ores) | [v1.3.1](https://modrinth.com/mod/universal_ores/version/1.3.1) | [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api/versions)* <br> [Dawn API](https://modrinth.com/mod/dawn/versions)*
[Modern Glass Doors](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modern-glass-doors) | [v2.1.0+1.18](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modern-glass-doors/files/3652303) | [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api/versions)*
[Patterned Glass](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/patterned-glass) | [v2.0.1+1.18](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/patterned-glass/files/3647402) | [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api/versions)*


\*Find a version for 1.18.2 (Under `Supports` it should say `1.18.2`) <br>
\*\*Find a version for 1.18.2 (Under `Game Version` it should say `1.18.2`; also, if there is a +1/+2/+3/etc. next to the thing under `Game Version`, hover over the +1/+2/+3/etc. to see all the versions the mod supports) <br>
\*\*\*This version of Consistency+ is mislabeled. While the modrinth page references version `0.5.1`, the file you download will have `0.5.0` in its name, but it is actually version `0.5.1`.

## Notes

If you have already installed ***any*** of the mods here for `1.18.2` *and* they are the correct versions (only applies if a specific version is provided here) *and* they are working, then there's no need to reinstall anything.
